# Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship
# Task 1 :
# Number Guessing Game (Java)
This project was made by me While working in Oasis Infobyte. A number guessing game is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 1 and 100 in a maximum of 10 attempts. The game will end after 10 attempts and if the player fails to guess the number, then he loses the game.
The approach is to generate a random number using the Math.random() method in Java. Now using a loop, take an input from the user and for each input print whether the number is smaller or larger than the actual number. If within a trial the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won. Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number.
Tecnology used : Java
IDE : Visual Studio.
